# Kali Linux File System

## Path
**/bin/: basic programs**  
**/boot/: Kali Linux kernel and other files required its early boot process**  
- In Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems, the /boot/ directory holds files used in booting the operating system.  
- The contents are mostly Linux kernel files or boot loader files, depending on the boot loader, most commonly (on Linux) LILO or GRUB.  
- Files:  
  - vmlinux – the Linux kernel[1]  
  - initrd.img – a temporary file system, used prior to loading the kernel[2]  
  - System.map – a symbol lookup table[3]
