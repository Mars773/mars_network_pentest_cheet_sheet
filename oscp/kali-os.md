# Kali Linux File System

## Path
**/bin/:**  
basic programs  
**/boot/:**  
Kali Linux kernel and other files required its early boot process   
> In Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems, the /boot/ directory holds files used in booting the operating system.  
> The contents are mostly Linux kernel files or boot loader files, depending on the boot loader, most commonly (on Linux) LILO or GRUB. 
> Files:  
  > vmlinux – the Linux kernel[1]  
  > initrd.img – a temporary file system, used prior to loading the kernel[2]  
  > System.map – a symbol lookup table[3]  
  
**/dev/:**  
device files  
> In Unix-like operating systems, a device file or special file is an interface to a device driver that appears in a file system as if it were an ordinary file.  
> These special files allow an application program to interact with a device by using its device driver via standard input/output system calls.  

**/etc/:**  
configuration files  
**/home/:**  
user's personal files  
**/lib/:**  
basic libraries  
**/media/\*:**  
mount points for removable devices (CD-ROM, USB keys...)  
**/mnt/:**  
temporary mount point  
**/opt/:**  
extra applications provided by third parties  
**/root/:**  
administrator's personal files  
**/run/:**  
volatile runtime data that does not persist across reboots (not yet included in the FHS)  
**/sbin/:**  
system programs  
**/srv/:**  
data used by servers hosted on this system 
**/tmp/:**  
temporary files (this directory is often emptied at boot)  
**/usr/:**  
applications (this directory is further subdivided into bin, sbin, lib according to the ssame logic as in the root directory) Futhermore, /usr/share/ contains architecture-independent data. The /usr/local/ directory is meant to be used by the administrator for installing applications manually without overwriting files handled by the pacckaging system (dpkg)  
**/var/:**  
variable data handled by daemons. This includes log files, queues, spools, and cashes.   
**/proc/ and /sys/**  
/proc/ and /sys/ are specific to the Linux kernel (and not part of the FHS). They are used by the kernel for exporting data to user space.  
  - See cpuinfo: `$ view /proc/cpuinfo`
